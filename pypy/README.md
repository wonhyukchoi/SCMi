# Python Virtual Machine

Implementation of the `Python` Virtual Machine in `Python` itself. 
Executes compiled `Python` bytecode.

Largely based on [`Byterun`](https://www.aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html). 

It is _not_ an implementation of [`PyPy`](https://www.pypy.org/), which is a JIT compiler using `RPython`.
